# Slappy Bird 2D Tower-Defence Style Game

...While following this tutorial, I also completed the first release of my 2D game and I gave the name of “Slappy Bird” to my game. This game is 2D tower-defence style game. Your character is an orc that defends our little bird which looks like a flappy bird. In this game, enemies spawn randomly in a specified range of the scene. Game has 2 enemies which differences each other from their attributes. These enemies’ abilities change after each stage. At the different scores, game stage changes automatically. At the beginning, our Slappy Bird has 5 health and whenever enemy monster touches bird, it loses one health. If bird’s health reaches 0, then we lost the game and if our score is in top 3, we can insert our name to the scoreboard. Orc is moved with the “WASD” keys. With the left button of mouse, we throw axe towards the direction that orc looks. We have ammo in our game and if it reaches 0, then we cannot throw axe anymore. When we pressed the left button of the mouse, we lose 1 ammo and throw axe. If throwed axe hits the enemy, we gain our lost ammo back. In every 10 seconds, we gain 1 ammo, too. I used ready sprites to build up my game. I have created 4 scenes for my entire game up to now. These are credits, start screen, high score, game scene. You can see different screenshots from my game, below:
